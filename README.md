The spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria globally is a pressing issue that has captured my attention.

- It's concerning to see how certain bacteria are becoming resistant to the drugs we use to treat them, leading to the rise of superbugs that are difficult to control.
- In 2017, WHO priority pathogens: A list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria assessed to be of highest priority for new antibiotic development.
- In 2019, nearly 1.3 million deaths including 140 thousand newborns were caused by AMR. This is expected to rise to 10 million deaths by 2050.
- Understanding the patterns and drivers of antimicrobial resistance, we can develop strategies to prevent its spread and improve patient outcomes.

## Features:

This web-based application has been developed to facilitate the exploration of the hospital microbiome.

The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for researchers and clinicians to analyze and visualize the metagenomic data generated from the hospital environment.

It offers a range of tools and features to help users identify taxonomy, track the spread of the pathogen, and understand their AMR, VFs, and MGEs profiles.
