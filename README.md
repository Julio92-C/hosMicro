The spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria globally is a pressing issue that has captured my attention.

- It's concerning to see how certain bacteria are becoming resistant to the drugs we use to treat them, leading to the rise of difficult-to-control superbugs.
- In 2017, the WHO published a list of priority pathogens including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, that were identified as high priority for new antibiotic development.
- In 2019, nearly 1.3 million deaths, including 140,000 newborns, were caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This number is expected to rise to 10 million deaths by 2050.
- By understanding the patterns and drivers of antimicrobial resistance, we can create strategies to prevent its spread and enhance patient outcomes.

## Features:

This web-based application has been developed to facilitate the exploration of the hospital microbiome.

The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for researchers and clinicians to analyze and visualize the metagenomic data generated from the hospital environment.

It offers a range of tools and features to help users identify taxonomy, track the spread of the pathogen, and understand their AMR, VFs, and MGEs profiles.
